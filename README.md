# Keybindings for VSCode on MacOS.

## Motivation

When using Vim Keybindings in VSCode, there are still times one might need to reach for the arrow keys. E.g. when selecting a file, or a code action.

These keybindings use native vim navigation `(j, k) + cmd` for navigating these sections.

## Usage

Update the file with:

```shell
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json keybindings.json
```

Use the keybindings in this repository with:

```shell
cp keybindings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/keybindings.json
```
